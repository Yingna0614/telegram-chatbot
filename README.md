# telegram-chatbot
Building a Telegram chatbot is easy and fun! Using BotFather and Python, I made a bot that can answer questions, summarize webpages, analyze PDFs or Word files, and even explain images. It keeps track of conversations, responding in real time like a smart study buddy. Anyone can try it and see how simple it is to turn ideas into a helpful bot!
